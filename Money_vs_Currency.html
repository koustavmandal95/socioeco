    <h1>Money Vs Currency</h1>
<p>
Let’s try to understand the definition of money .For which we have to go back into the past .As Winston Churchill once said “The Further you look into the past the further you could see into the future.” I believe the biggest investment u can make today is to educate yourself about economics, what exactly is money ,why currency is not money and how stock market and bank system can scam you ?
Definition of currency anything which can be considered as medium of exchange, unit of account, divisible, fungible (interchangeable) now money is everything like currency but money is also a store of value for long period. For instance in 1971 24 karat per 10 gram was Rs 173 .But can you buy 24 karat 10 grams of gold for Rs 173 today ? This blunder of our monetary system and very rarely you will see people talk about this. In every crises any monetary system across the globe has one solution “Print more currency”.
As this currency is created out of thin air in name of "Quantitative easing" there are consequences with increase in currency supply prices goes higher an inflation which India faced in last term of Congress government (2009-14). This brings us to topic demonetization actually which I suspect was an absolute necessity to put a break on inflation but question was it any good for long duration of time? Well i will leave that question to an economist. I am an Engineer who wants to create monetary awareness for students educated for 16+ years by society blindly not being told all this yet.
Coming back to Gold & Silver from Egyptians to Roman Empire till today have been able to store it’s purchasing power. In last 50 years value of US Dollars have gone done & most of countries trade in US dollars. Get a Mercedes from Germany pay them US dollars, get hardware from China pay them in US Dollars etc. In year 1971 president Richard Nixon took US dollars from Gold standards as country like France soon released dependency on US dollars can be threatening, they went with US dollars asking their Gold from USA seeing French other nations tried same .President Richard Nixon had to take USA from gold standards as there was more currency printed than physical gold in US Treasury.
Remember Governments can always print currency but can’t print or create gold or silver. Gold and Silver are real money because it’s finite and high in demand  even though stock market calls it protective and slow investment but significant amount of Gold and silver in your portfolio can weather the storm.
