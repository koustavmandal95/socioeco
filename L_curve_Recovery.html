    <div>
        <h3 class="">L curve is More Real Why?</h3>
        <p>
        For V Curve Recovery there has to be a overwhelming pent up demand. Predominantly we are having a service based economy
        which means if someone is missing out on a dinner in a restaurant or a vacation trip these economic transaction loses 
        are permanent but on other side if someone was planning to buy an electronics goods there can be pent up demand.But Would u fancy
        buying a luxurious car in middle of a pandemic.
        </p>
        <h4 class="">Why L Shape Not V shape</h4>
        <p class="">
        From 2018 we are in economic slowdown  after the central banks in Europe went on to do the <em>"Quantitative Tightening"</em>
        (which means to drain the currency supply) but the situation worse after USA-China war on trade . There was huge gap in demand 
        of goods and services due to slow economic growth. There is considerable amount of growth in GDP of countries around the world.
        Upon on this a Predominant fear of infection due to virus will definitely increase the umemployement .People are slowly moving 
        into <strong><em>survial & saving mode</em></strong> rather than spending & expanding mode.
        </p>
        <h4 class="">Why Helicopter-Money Bomb will fail.</h4>
        <p class="">
        In a crises situation any central bank around the world is under immense pressure by their respective government to increase the 
        currency supply and reduce the repo rate to keep the value of paper assets up and let it not turn into junk bonds but printing money
        can't be the only solution of this problem because people are far from spending mode. Even though the value of paper currency is getting 
        de-valued people are happy with their cash in their pockets in crises. So we are slowly moving towards a deflationary period where
        umemployement will be peeking and contraction of the economy. As a rule of economy someone's spending is someone's income.
        <span>There is no point printing currency if the velocity of the currency is zero. </span>
        </p>
        <h4 class="">Create Healty Inflation to avoid deflation.</h4>
        <p class="gold">
        There is term called "beautiful deleveraging" but for deleveraging to happen properly we need an angel to buy all the assets including
        (paper,gold,real estate,equity) well government can be that angel .
            <span>
                Imagine a situation where Gold prices goes up to $5000 USD so every small 
                investor on gold will happy to sell their gold to the government .The profits due to gold selling will drive the prices of goods and services up and
                people might to tempted to buy goods and services seeing the inflation in present(increase in prices) than future going up.Invetsors profit on gold will demandly have positive impact
                on all the markets .

        <h4>Reference to History</h4>
        <p>
            Back in History 1933 President Roosevelt increase the Gold prices,made hoarding of gold illegal under "Executive order 6102"
            and the government bought the gold in exchange of US Dollars and later further increased the price of the gold. It was perfect 
            insider trading but Hay! it was done to save the american economy . Desperate times comes despirate Measures. So ideally Govts can 
            come after ur gold or influence you to sell ur gold for higher price and profit in exchange of fiat currency.
