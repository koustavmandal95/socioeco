    <div>
        <h3 class="">L curve is More Real Why?</h3>
        <p>
        For V Curve Recovery there has to be a overwhelming pent up demand. Predominantly we are having a service based economy
        which means if someone is missing out on a dinner in a restaurant or a vacation trip these economic transaction loses 
        are permanent but on other side if someone was planning to buy an electronic good there can be pent up demand.But Would u fancy
        buying a luxurious car in middle of a pandemic?
        </p>
        <h4 class="">Why L Shape Not V shape</h4>
        <p class="">
        From 2018 we are in economic slowdown  after the central banks in Europe went on to do the <em>"Quantitative Tightening"</em>
        (which means to drain the currency supply) but the situation worsen after USA-China war on trade . There was huge gap in demand 
        of goods and services due to slow economic growth. The GDP is on decline around the world.
        Upon this a Predominant fear of infection due to virus will definitely increase the umemployement .People are slowly moving 
        into <strong><em>survial & saving mode</em></strong> rather than spending & expanding mode.
        </p>
        <h4 class="">Why Helicopter-Money Bomb will fail.</h4>
        <p class="">
        In a crises situation any central bank around the world is under immense pressure by their respective government to increase the 
        currency supply and reduce the repo rate to keep the value of paper assets up and let it not turn into junk bonds but printing money
        can't be the only solution to this problem because people are far away from spending mode. Even though the value of paper currency is getting 
        devalued people are happy with the cash in their pockets in crises. So we are slowly moving towards a deflationary period where
        umemployement will be peeking and contraction of the economy seems inevitable.As a rule of economics someone's spending is someone's income.
        <span>There is no point printing currency if the velocity of the currency is zero. </span>
        </p>
        <h4 class="">Create Healty Inflation to avoid deflation.</h4>
        <p class="gold">
        There is term called "beautiful deleveraging" but for deleveraging to happen properly we need an angel to buy all the assets including
        (paper,gold,real estate,equity) well government can be that angel .
            <span>
                Imagine a situation where Gold prices goes up to $3000 USD per Ounce so every small 
                investor on gold will be happy to sell their gold.The profits due to gold selling will drive the prices of goods and services up and
                people might be tempted to buy goods and services in present seeing the inflation(increase in prices) rather than in future.Invetsors profit on gold will definitly have positive impact
                on all the markets . 
            <span>

        <h4>Reference to History</h4>
        <p>
            Back in History 1933 President Roosevelt increase the Gold prices,made hoarding of gold illegal under "Executive order 6102"
            and the government bought the gold in exchange of US Dollars and later further increased the price of the gold. It was perfect 
            insider trading but Hay! it was done to save the american economy .With desperate times comes desperate measures. So ideally Govts can 
            come after ur gold or influence you to sell ur gold for higher price and profit in exchange of fiat currency.
