    <h1>Demand and Supply chain</h1>
<p>
  <strong>The Cheese in a mouse trap is always free. – From Graffiti </strong> <br>
  To understand market we have to see from the eyes producer and consumer. A market is a place where Buyer and seller enter into for an economic transact for the sole purpose of maximizing profit .There are certain variables which the market need to take in account Supply and demand. The true idea of a market is to find the Equilibrium Price.
  Equilibrium Price is that price at which the quantity of demand is equal to quantity supplied.
</p>
  <h3 class="griffen">Griffen’s Paradox</h3>
  <div> Sir Robert Griffen in 19th century observed that low paid British workers purchased more bread when the price of bread started to increase than when the price of bread was low or normal. I feel till today consumers have this intension of stocking essential commodities in case of uprising of price.</div>
  <p class="para">
  Any seller’s idea is to drive this Equilibrium price to this profit but every often than not the production or the supply side exceeds the demand side hence a surplus is created. Surplus can also created in case of lack of demand of goods in market. In this case the buyer takes the advantage of low pricing or offers etc.
  During the uprising prices there is a temptation for producer side to increase the production at cost of expensive investment in a limited time frame which can maximize the overall profit but in long term there is certain risk of overproduction. Suppose you want to buy a phone in March but you realise during winter season there are discount on the same commodity. You wait and avoid any temptation this a  market intelligence from consumer .For which Producer is not prepared so he faced a loss .For next term producer only built a limited number of phone to avoid surplus and kept the maximum profit within limit. This entire phenomenon is finding the equilibrium price.

  <strong>When Demand more supply less :-</strong> In this situation any 6th std student can say the prices will go up but till what rates is where the True beast of a Market shows up with various currency around the world depreciated like trash of paper the price can sky rocket in case of high demand and scare supply chain. Definitely many hoarders act to take advantage of this situation where Government must step in because in this situation the producers have actually sell their goods at a far lesser prices.
</p>
<p class="para_sol">
  <strong>Solutions:-</strong> In such cases there should be limit on the quantity that can be sold by a particular merchant for a time frame. Immediate imports of goods from foreign nations otherwise what happened during French revolution for a piece of bread is world know fact. There is always some form of violence seen  in these economic patterns from French revolution to till today . Warehouse fires ,mob lynching the history does repeats itself.<br>
